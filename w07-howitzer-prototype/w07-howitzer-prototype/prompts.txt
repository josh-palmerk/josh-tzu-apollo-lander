let's make a C++ class that we will run a physics simulation through (firing a howitzer shell). we will consistently add to it with things like gravity, accel, ground impact, etc. but for now let's just start with methods for calculating inertia, updating position, and running one timestep (0.01s). please also include member vars to hold information like hang time, altitude, and distance traveled. you may create stubs, vars, and constants that may be useful in future steps.

okay we will be simulating the m777 howitzer (muzzle velocity 827.0 m/s) shooting a m795 155mm (weight 46.7kg, diameter 154.89mm). we can later add a reference table for drag coefficients that is measured in various intervals between mach 0 and 5, if this is at all necessary. 0 degrees is straight up. for now, our external main() simulator function will only calculate 20 timesteps shooting this projectile at muzzle velocity from 0m elevation at a 75 degree angle, so for now just write the necessary code to do that small function and we will expand soon
